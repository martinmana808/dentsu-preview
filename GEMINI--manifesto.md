## D4 Preview: The Spirit of Visualization

### The What
**D4 Preview** is a sophisticated visualization engine designed to bridge the gap between data and design. It serves as an interactive canvas where complex hierarchies, map data, and ad creatives converge into a unified, coherent experience.

### The Why
In a world of fragmented data tools, we need a single point of truth that doesn't just show numbers, but renders context. We are building this to empower users to visualize not just the "what" but the "where" and "how" of their campaigns and structures.

### The Core
*   **Precision:** Pixel-perfect rendering of ad creatives and components.
*   **Clarity:** Demystifying complex hierarchies through intuitive tree views.
*   **Agility:** A lightning-fast Svelte 5 implementation that iterates as fast as thought.

### Future
We aim to evolve D4 Preview into the standard for creative and data visualization previews, expanding its capabilities to support real-time collaboration and deeper integration with external data sources.
